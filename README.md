# Nihilnaser-Data-Transformation-Visualization
In this assignment, I undertook an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing detailed sales information. To effectively communicate the findings, I utilized several visualization techniques. The analysis included the creation of card charts to highlight key metrics: total sales, customer count, total profit, and total shipping costs. These card charts provide a clear, at-a-glance summary of the essential performance indicators.  Additionally, I created a variety of other charts to delve deeper into the data. Stacked bar charts were used to illustrate the distribution of sales across different categories, allowing for a comparative analysis of various segments. Pie charts were employed to show proportions and contributions of different elements to the overall metrics, offering a visual representation of the dataset's composition.  To further enhance the understanding of performance, I incorporated two table charts. These tables provide a detailed breakdown of the data, enabling a more granular analysis of performance metrics and trends.  Furthermore, I have included a video in the repository that demonstrates the interactive aspects of the dashboard. The video showcases how users can navigate between different pages by clicking on buttons, providing a dynamic and user-friendly experience for exploring the data insights. This interactive feature enhances the overall usability and accessibility of the analysis, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of the sales information.
